UCI Patient Flow is a Java-based Spring Boot application designed to streamline patient registration and queue management in urgent care or hospital environments.

The system enables walk-in patients to register, receive a queue ticket, and track their waiting status, while medical staff can monitor and prioritize patients efficiently.

Built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, Lombok for cleaner code, and a strong testing suite to ensure maintainability and reliability.
